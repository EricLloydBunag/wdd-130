      <h3>Purpose</h3>

        marinade seeping into quality milkfish, and smoking it to perfection, we guarantee that your meals will be a blast! </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Our target audience is mostly the people living in our city, where the practice of smoking fish is not really known. 
        By introducing this recipe to the people, we aim towards those who are curious about its amazing taste, and foodies all over,
        hopefully reaching outside the borders of the city.
