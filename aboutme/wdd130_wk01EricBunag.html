        Hi! My name is Eric Lloyd Bunag. My friends just call me Eric, but you can call me Lloyd if that one rolls better on your tongue.
        I'm from the Philippines, and I live in the southern island of Mindanao!

        I'm looking to have a degree in software development, so that I can move closer to my dream of being in the game dev industry. And 
        if that doesn't work, I can have a normal job just creating software. When I'm not studying, I watch anime, draw, or work on my 
        passion project, which is a game.

        I was born in the church, so I love everything about it. I learned to appreciate it more when I served a mission. If I had to give
        a favorite scripture, it would be <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/25?lang=eng#:~:
        text=23%20For%20we%20labor%20diligently%20to%20write%2C%20to%20persuade%20our%20children%2C%20and%20also%20our%20brethren%2C
        %20to%20believe%20in%20Christ%2C%20and%20to%20be%20reconciled%20to%20God%3B%20for%20we%20know%20that%20it%20is%20by%20grace%2
        0that%20we%20are%20saved%2C%20after%20all%20we%20can%20do." 2 Nephi 25:23></a>. I love it because it instills hope in me that all I
        have to do is do my best, and Jesus Christ will take care of everything that I lack.
